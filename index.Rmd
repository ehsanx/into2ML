# Preface {-}

This document is a very basic introduction to machine learning.

## Goal  {-}

- Basic Machine Learning Terminologies (pre-reading)
- Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
  - Concepts
  - Examples
- Over-Fitting, Measuring Performance and Model Tuning
  - Overall steps

## Pre-requisites {-}

The prerequisites are knowledge of multiple regression analysis and basic probability. Software demonstrations and codes will be provided in R, although proficiency in R is not required for understanding the concepts.

## Key references {-}
