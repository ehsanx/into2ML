# Preface {-}

This document is a very basic introduction to machine learning for Medicine.

## Goal  {-}

- Part I: Basics
  - Basic Machine Learning Terminologies (pre-reading)
  - Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
    - Concepts
    - Examples
  - Over-Fitting, Measuring Performance and Model Tuning
    - Overall steps
- Part II: Application in Medical Literature
  - Model development
  - Model validation
  - Clinical implementation
  

## Philosophy  {-}

**Code-first** philosophy is adopted for this tutorial; demonstrating the **analyses through one real data analysis** problem used in the literature. 

- This tutorial is not theory-focused, nor utilizes simulated data to explain the ideas. Given the focus on implementation, theory is beyond the scope of this tutorial. 

## Pre-requisites {-}

- The prerequisites are knowledge of multiple regression analysis and basic probability. Software demonstrations and codes will be provided in R, although proficiency in R is not required for understanding the concepts.
